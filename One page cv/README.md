# A Single-Page CV built by using HTML 

## Requirements for this project:
In this project, we are required to create a single-page CV (Curriculum Vitae) using only HTML.

### Key requirements for this project:

- Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your CV.

- SEO Meta Tags: Include essential meta tags for SEO.

- Open Graph (OG) Tags: Add OG tags for better social media sharing.

- Favicon: Add a favicon for your CV page.

  The structure of your CV should be easily understandable and ready for styling in a future project.
  
## Goals:
The goal of this project is to learn how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. We will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner.

- Semantically correct HTML structure.
- Single-page layout with sections for education, skills, and career history.
- SEO meta tags in the head section.
- OG tags for better social media sharing.
- A favicon linked in the head section.
